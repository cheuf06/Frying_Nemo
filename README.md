# Frying_Nemo
# Written Proposal - Draft
## Introduction & Concept

A healthy and balanced diet is integral towards developing minds and concentration. However, despite this nearly 33% of all school aged children fail to receive a balanced and healthy diet whilst at school according to a study conducted by the New York Times. Further, of the 68% who do get a healthy lunch, based upon a study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 25% of them even bother to eat it all.

Taking this into consideration the team, ‘Frying Nemo’, is dedicated towards developing and implementing an application which helps parents in creating and maintaining a meal plan for their children which is easy, healthy and above all tasty.

Given the picky eating habits of young children, this application allows you to search for healthy recipes and meals which do/don’t include, certain ingredients/vegetables. This also allows parents to cater towards specific diets, such as nut intolerances and celiacs.

Whilst the application does initially draw upon recipe websites, through RESTful api’s, the design is intended towards a more community outlook, allowing parents to rate recipes as well as upload their own. This would ideally create a more balanced meal plan which caters towards children’s diets and preferences as the application becomes more available.

This idea has a strong starting platform, as there are no other applications out there which have these features implemented. Whilst, there are quite a few meal planners none of them are designed with children in mind, in particular their picky and constant changing food preferences and diets. Further, no other application exists which allows the user to craft their own recipes for the community or for themselves.

### Rating Systems for the application
    * Having parents preferences
    * Children preferences
    * Costs
    * Delicacies of the food

## Meetings and Contact
We will hold meetings in the studio sessions - members are expected to attend, or to notify their teammates, ideally within 24 hours, if they cannot make it via the Slack group or SMS. Other meetings will be arranged as necessary, arranged a week in advance, to ensure that all members can attend. If members cannot attend, arrangements will be made to facilitate the meeting through Google Hangouts. Normal communication will be through slack and email. Members are expected to check these as often as possible and at least every 2 working days, and should notify the group if they are going to be out of contact for more than a 3 working days.
Any information which is produced for the development of the project must be submitted to either the shared google drive or github repository, ‘Frying-Nemo’. Any information or links which are not required by the entire/majority of the group may be shared via Slack, where appropriate. Google Drive and Github were chosen due to the permanency of their storage options, as opposed to Slack which deletes content after a period of time, as well as the ease in which each member’s contributions towards the team can be tracked.

## Task Division
Tasks will be allocated using Scrum principles and through discussion within the group. Group members are expected to do their best to deliver tasks on time, and should contact the group in advance if they anticipate being unable to do so. Tasks will be posted on Trello.
The division of labour in the team will be assessed halfway through the project to determine if each member has been contributing roughly the same amount of story points to the project. If one team member is contributing 15% or less story points relative to other team members, this will be considered a major breach and dealt with in the guidelines below.
Dispute Resolution

## Non-Compliance
A minor non-compliance issue is defined as an action that does not seriously undermine the quality of the project or function of the group but still impedes progress to a degree. Such infractions can usually be quickly amended by a willing team member with no overall impact on the project.
Examples:
* Being more than 15 minutes late to two meetings or more without good reason
* Missing more than two meetings without good reason
* Not completing work by an agreed upon date, if this date is before the actual due date of the material
* Being unproductive or disruptive at meetings
* Taking on too much work, not asking for help and allowing this to impact the quality
* Altering someone else’s work without consulting them first
* Not responding to Online/Telephonic communications within 1 - 2 days

A major non-compliance issue is defined as a breach of the team agreement that severely impacts the quality of the project. Such actions may be irreparable or require a great deal of work and time to fix that the team may have to take off of other projects.
Examples:
* Not completing work by the assignment due date
* Insulting/Undermining other team members during meetings or repeatedly causing non-constructive arguments
* Not attending any meetings
* Drastically changing or removing sections of the project completed by another team member without first consulting the team and abiding by their decision
* Completely ignoring all requests for communication within the Team

## Dispute Resolution & Conflict Management
Minor or major non-compliance with this Agreement is likely to manifest as disputes or conflicts between team members.

## Minor Breaches - Resolution
The first step in resolving minor breaches will be to mention the issue with the team member/s committing the offence in a non confrontational manner, as it would be counter productive to let issues slowly mount over time and unfair to both the team member and the rest of the team. The entire team will look to find a resolution to the issue as soon as possible, so as to allow work to continue without disruption.

If this is the first or second minor breach a team member has committed then no further action will be taken. If a series of minor breaches occur then the third and subsequent breaches will be dealt with as if they were a major breach.

## Major Breaches - Resolution
In the event of a major breach, a team meeting will be called to discuss the breach in a fair manner. Depending on the severity of the breach and the justification for lack of work the team may decide to redistribute the work in order to get the task complete.  In any case, a member committing a first major breach will receive a verbal warning, along with a list of fair tasks allocated by the rest of the team to make up for the breach, with specific success criteria and a specific and fair deadline.

If the team member commits another major breach, or these tasks are not completed by the assigned deadline then a similar meeting will be called, where once again the other team members, by unanimous decision, may decide to redistribute the unfinished workload and the teaching staff of DECO3500 will be informed of this counterproductive attitude.. The team member will then receive a written warning and a new list of tasks to complete with specific success criteria and a specific deadline to demonstrate improvement.

If these tasks are not completed or another major breach is committed, the list of uncompleted deadlines, excuses and workload will be passed to the DECO3500 staff whereby peer assessment may be used to scale the offenders grade.
