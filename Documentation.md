In your documentation we would expect to see examples of the evidence you have gathered, such as graphs,
quotes or observations from surveys, interviews or academic studies. We would also expect to see images of
physical evidence, such as photographs of users, sketches, wireframes or functioning websites.

## Background
A healthy and balanced diet is integral towards developing minds and concentration. However, despite this nearly 33% of all school aged children fail to receive a balanced and healthy diet whilst at school according to a study conducted by the New York Times (2015). Further, of the 68% who do get a healthy lunch, based upon a study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 25% of them even bother to eat it all (Medical Daily, 2014).
## Introduction & Concept
Taking this into consideration the team, ‘Frying Nemo’, is dedicated towards developing and implementing an application which helps parents in creating and maintaining a meal plan for their children which is easy, healthy and above all tasty.

Given the picky eating habits of young children, this application allows you to search for healthy recipes and meals which do/don’t include, certain ingredients/vegetables. This also allows parents to cater towards specific diets, such as nut intolerances and celiacs.

Whilst the application does initially draw upon recipe websites, through RESTful api’s, the design is intended towards a more community outlook, allowing parents to rate recipes as well as upload their own. This would ideally create a more balanced meal plan which caters towards children’s diets and preferences as the application becomes more available.

This idea has a strong starting platform, as there are no other applications out there which have these features implemented. Whilst, there are quite a few meal planners none of them are designed with children in mind, in particular their picky and constant changing food preferences and diets. Further, no other application exists which allows the user to craft their own recipes for the community or for themselves.
